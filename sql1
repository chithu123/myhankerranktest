Write a query to print all prime numbers less than or equal to . Print your result on a single line, and use the ampersand () character as your separator (instead of a space).

For example, the output for all prime numbers  would be:

2&3&5&7

    GROUP_CONCAT(n SEPARATOR '&') AS primes

         a.n
