Explanation

The first column is an alphabetically ordered list of Doctor names.
The second column is an alphabetically ordered list of Professor names.
The third column is an alphabetically ordered list of Singer names.
The fourth column is an alphabetically ordered list of Actor names.
The empty cell data for columns with less than the maximum number of names per occupation (in this case, the Professor and Actor columns) are filled with NULL values.

WITH RankedNames AS (
    SELECT 
        Name,
        Occupation,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Occupation ORDER BY Name) AS rn
    FROM OCCUPATIONS
)
SELECT 
    MAX(CASE WHEN Occupation = 'Doctor' THEN Name ELSE NULL END) AS Doctor,
    MAX(CASE WHEN Occupation = 'Professor' THEN Name ELSE NULL END) AS Professor,
    MAX(CASE WHEN Occupation = 'Singer' THEN Name ELSE NULL END) AS Singer,
    MAX(CASE WHEN Occupation = 'Actor' THEN Name ELSE NULL END) AS Actor
FROM RankedNames
GROUP BY rn
ORDER BY rn;
